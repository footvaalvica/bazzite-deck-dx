# Bazzite Developer Edition

[![Build Bazzite DX](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-deck-dx/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-deck-dx/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is just bazzite, but with extra developer-specific tooling, aiming to match [Bluefin DX](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/bluefin-dx/) and [Aurora DX](https://docs.getaurora.dev/guides/developer/) in functionality

`bazzite-gdx` will source from here and be focused for game development.
